<h1>Networks TicTacToe Game</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Project consists of a <b>client-server based Tic-Tac-Toe game</b> built as part of a <b>Computer Networks course project.</b>
Two players connect to a server to play Tic-Tac-Toe, while an additional <b>spectator client</b> can join to observe the game in real time.  
Also includes a presentation to explain architecture, protocols used, and game flow.  
The project demonstrates fundamental networking concepts such as <b>socket programming, message passing, and client-server communication</b>.  
<br />
<br />
<br />

<b>Course outcomes and skills</b>  
This course provided an in-depth understanding of computer networking principles, protocols, and security concepts, paired with hands-on experience simulating real-world networks. Key technical skills and knowledge gained include:  
- Comprehensive understanding of the <b>OSI and TCP/IP models</b> and their layers, enabling analysis and design of scalable networks  
- <b>Routing and switching</b> techniques, including subnetting, IP addressing, and packet forwarding, critical for network configuration and troubleshooting  
- Proficiency with core <b>network protocols</b> such as TCP, UDP, HTTP, and IP, understanding their operation, use cases, and packet structure  
- Practical skills with network monitoring and diagnostic tools: <b>Wireshark</b> for packet analysis and <b>traceroute</b> for path discovery  
- Fundamentals of <b>network security</b>, including firewalls, VPNs, and encryption methods, preparing for secure system deployment  
- Applied knowledge in a hands-on project: developed a <b>multiplayer Tic Tac Toe game</b> over a network using <b>Python sockets</b>, demonstrating client-server architecture, real-time message passing, synchronization, and basic security considerations
